## About Me
Hello! My name is Sean and I am a recent graduate from the University of Washington. As we know, information is at the crux of human learning and advancements. The power of data in the digital era of human society today has intrigued me to further contribute to such innovations. I am seeking for whatever opportunities enable me to pursue my passion and love for Data Science, all while finding ways in which I can contribute to the everlasting changes we see through digital technologies. With the skills and knowledge I have attained throughout my academic career and recent internship, I hope to gain further experience/insights to expedite my growth as an aspiring Data Engineer/Analyst. The purpose and design of this git repo is to display a fusion of my knowledge in data and love for sports.
