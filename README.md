## About
Player Efficieny Rating (PER), created by John Hollinger, is a holistic metric commonly used in basketball analytics to measure and evaluate a player's on-court statistical performances/contributions into one number. While Hollinger has developed a system that effectively rates an individual player quite precisely, there are many factors that go into it which can be very difficult/frustrating to acquire from open data sources (i.e. team pace v. league pace). Because of this, I was motivated to calculate a linear-weighted PER and rids any factors outside of an indivdual's very own performance.

* The idea to use linear weighted PER formula instead of John Hollinger's original PER formula was influenced because of an article found from [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/113144-cracking-the-code-how-to-calculate-hollingers-per-without-all-the-mess)
